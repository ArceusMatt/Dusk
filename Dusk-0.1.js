Grab current activity the launcher is running on.
https://github.com/zhuowei/MCPELauncher/blob/master/src/com/mojang/minecraftpe/MainActivity.java
This global variable ctx is used to run things on this activity.
Mostly will be used to display graphical user interface(s)
Since it seems more logical to name it MainActivity instead of ctx & ctx is a global variable, i will.
